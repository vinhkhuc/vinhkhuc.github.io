### Introduction
**Recurrent Neural Network** (**RNN**) is a neural network which has at least one feedback loop. RNN defines a non-linear 
dynamic system which can learn the mapping from input sequences to output sequences. RNN is considered [the deepest of 
all neural networks](http://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/2xcyrl/i_am_j%C3%BCrgen_schmidhuber_ama/cp43748). 
RNN has many forms and the simplest one is a Multilayer Perceptron where previous hidden nodes feed back into the network.

For language modeling (i.e. predicting the next word based on previous words), RNN significantly outperforms the standard 
N-gram-based methods. 

However, RNN is difficult to train since it suffers from the vanishing / exploding gradient effects
where error signals become smaller and smaller (in the vanishing case) / larger and larger (in the exploding case) when 
back-propagating errors from output layer back to input layer.

h_t &= \sigma(W_{xh} x_t + W_{hh} h_{t-1} + b_h) \\
y_t &= softmax(W_{hy} h_t + b_y)
\end{align}
$$

where $$\sigma$$ is sigmoid function $$\sigma(x) = \frac{1}{1+e^{-x}}$$ in case of binary classification or a softmax function
$$\sigma(x) = (\frac{e^{x_1}}{\sum_{i=1}^L e^{x_1} + ... + e^{x_L}}, ... \frac{e^{x_L}}{\sum_{i=1}^L e^{x_1} + ... + e^{x_L}})$$.

**Long Short-Term Memory** (**LSTM**) is a variant of RNN which was proposed to resolve the vanishing / exploding gradient problems. 
LSTM has memory nodes that helps the network learn when to forget previous hidden states and when to update hidden states 
given new input. LSTM has been used very successfully in handwriting recognition.

\begin{align}
i_t &= \sigma(W_{wi} x_t + W_{hi} h_{t-1} + b_i)  \\
f_t &= \sigma(W_{xf} x_t + W_{hf} h_{t-1} + b_f)  \\
o_t &= \sigma(W_{xo} x_t + W_{ho} h_{t-1} + b_o)  \\
g_t &= \varphi(W_{xc} x_t + W_{hc} h_{t-1} + b_c) \\
c_t &= f_t \odot c_{t-1} + i_t \odot g_t          \\
h_t &= o_t \odot \varphi(c_t)
\end{align}
$$

where $$\sigma$$ is sigmoid function, $$\varphi$$ is tanh function, and $$\odot$$ is 
element-wise product.

### Backpropagation
An RNN with the length $$T$$ is actually a feed-forward neutral network with the depth $$T$$. For simplicity, here we will 
derive backpropagation steps to train the vanilla RNN (Figure 2) for a classification task.

Given a training data set $$D = \{(X_i, \bar{Y}_i)\}_{i=1}^N$$, where $$X_i$$ and $$\bar{Y}_i$$ are two sequences with 
length $$T$$, $$X_i=(X_{i1}, ..., X_{iT})$$, $$\bar{Y}_i=(\bar{Y}_{i1}, ..., \bar{Y}_{iT})$$, the loss function is 
a log-loss, i.e. cross entropy between the ground truth sequence $$\bar{Y}$$ and the predicted sequence $$Y$$: 

$$L(\bar{Y}, Y) = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N \frac{1}{T} \sum_{t=1}^T CE(\bar{Y}_{it}, Y_{it})$$

where $$CE(\bar{y}, y) = -\sum_{l=1}^L \bar{y}^l \log y^l$$ ($$L$$ is the number of labels, $$\bar{y}^l$$ and $$y^l$$ are
components of the vectors $$\bar{y}$$ and $$y$$ respectively).

Stochastic Gradient Descent (**SGD**) will be used for training. Assuming one training example is provided at a time, 
the loss function becomes $$L(\bar{Y}, Y) = \frac{1}{T} \sum_{t=1}^T CE(\bar{y}_t, y_t)$$. 

$$L(\bar{Y}, Y)$$ minimizes $$\Longleftrightarrow$$ $$\sum_{t=1}^T CE(\bar{y}_t, y_t)$$ minimizes.

The forward pass is pretty straightforward as shown in Figure 2. The backward pass is quite tricky due to the link between
$$h_{t-1}$$ and $$h_t$$.

We will backpropagate the error from $$t = T$$ back to $$t = 1$$:

**1)** Backpropagate to $$y_t^{raw}$$

Assuming that the ground truth label is $$l$$, we have 

$$L_t = CE(\bar{y}_t, y_t) = - \log y_l = - y_l^{raw} + \log A$$ 

where $$y = softmax(y^{raw})$$ and $$A$$ is $$softmax$$'s normalization factor.

$$
\frac{\partial L_t}{\partial y_t^{raw}} = -1 + \frac{1}{A} \times \frac{\partial A}{\partial y_t^{raw}}
                                        = -1 + \frac{1}{A} \times A \times e^{y_t^{raw}}
                                        = -1 + e^{y_t^{raw}}
$$


**2)** Backpropagate to $$W_{hy}$$ and $$b_y$$

$$
\begin{align}
\frac{\partial L_t}{\partial W_{hy}} &= \frac{\partial L_t}{\partial h^{raw}} \times \frac{\partial h^{raw}}{\partial W_{hy}}
                                     = \frac{\partial L_t}{\partial h^{raw}} \times h_t \\
\frac{\partial L_t}{\partial b_y} &= \frac{\partial L_t}{\partial h^{raw}}                     
\end{align}
$$

**3)** Backpropagate to $$h_t$$

Since both $$L_t$$ and $$L_{t+1}$$ depend on $$h_t$$, we need to consider both of them for this backpropagation step:

$$
\begin{align}
\frac{\partial (L_t + L_{t+1})}{\partial h_t} 
   &= \frac{\partial L_t}{\partial h_t} + \frac{\partial L_{t+1}}{\partial h_t} \\
   &= \frac{\partial L_t}{\partial y_t^{raw}} \times  \frac{\partial y_t^{raw}}{\partial h_t}
            + \frac{\partial L_{t+1}}{\partial h_{t+1}} \times \frac{\partial h_{t+1}}{\partial h_t} \\
   &= \frac{\partial L_t}{\partial y_t^{raw}} \times W_{hy} 
            + \frac{\partial L_{t+1}}{\partial h_{t+1}} \times h_t \times (h_t - 1) \times W_{hh} \\
\end{align}
$$

**4)** Backpropagate to $$h_t^{raw}$$

$$
\frac{\partial L_t}{\partial h_t^{raw}} 
    = \frac{\partial L_t}{\partial h_t} \times \frac{\partial h_t}{\partial h_t^{raw}}
    = \frac{\partial L_t}{\partial h_t} \times h_t \times h_{t+1}   
$$

**5)** Backpropagate to $$W_{xh}$$, $$W_{hh}$$, and $$b_h$$ 

$$
\begin{align}
\frac{\partial L_t}{\partial W_{xh}} &= \frac{\partial L_t}{\partial h_t^{raw}} \times x_t \\
\frac{\partial L_t}{\partial W_{hh}} &= \frac{\partial L_t}{\partial h_t^{raw}} \times h_{t-1} \\
\frac{\partial L_t}{\partial b_h} &= \frac{\partial L_t}{\partial h_t^{raw}}
\end{align}
$$
